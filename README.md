This project explores Pascal’s Triangle through a combination of visual and conceptual analysis using MANIM, an advanced animation library tailored for mathematical demonstrations. 
The initiative aims to enhance comprehension, particularly for learners who struggle with abstract concepts, by leveraging AI-generated MANIM code to dynamically illustrate the triangle’s construction, properties, and intricate patterns. 
These include symmetry, binomial coefficients, connections to the Fibonacci sequence, and fractals. 
The outcome is a cinematic educational video designed to transform complex mathematical ideas into intuitive and engaging visual experiences.
