# Pascal’s Triangle Visualized with MANIM

## Project Overview
This project explores **Pascal’s Triangle** through an immersive combination of **visual** and **conceptual analysis** using **[MANIM](https://www.manim.community/)** an advanced Python animation library tailored for mathematical demonstrations developed by Grant Sanderson (3Blue1Brown)

Our goal is to transform complex mathematical ideas into **intuitive, cinematic experiences** that make learning **engaging and accessible**, especially for students who find abstract concepts challenging.

## Features
- Dynamic construction of Pascal’s Triangle using MANIM animations  
- AI-generated MANIM code for streamlined development and experimentation  
- In-depth visual demonstrations of:
  - Symmetry within the triangle  
  - Binomial coefficients and their significance  
  - Connections to the Fibonacci sequence  
  - Fractal patterns hidden within the triangle

## Purpose
This initiative is designed as an **educational video** that bridges the gap between **abstract theory and visual intuition** bringing mathematical beauty to life for learners.
